Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form.

Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)",
